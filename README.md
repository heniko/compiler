# Compiler
This project was made for University of Helsinki courses [Compilers](https://studies.helsinki.fi/opintotarjonta/cu/hy-CU-119366777-2021-08-01/CSM14204/Compilers) and [Code Generation](https://studies.helsinki.fi/opintotarjonta/cu/hy-CU-119366863-2021-08-01/CSM14205/Code_Generation). Project was made using Rust since I thought this project would be a perfect place to test and learn it. Due to working within the course deadlines, using a new language and this being the first compiler I have written the code is not very optimized and some parts may not even work as intended. The course is over so this project will likely not get updated.

The programming language used with this compiler is Pascal-inspired (Called MiniPL). During the Code Generation course the interpreter part was discarded as the language changed a lot and now the compiler produces low level simplified (and very unoptimized) C as a target language.
